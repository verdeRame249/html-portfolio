<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have been specializing in data analysis, <b>creative thinking</b> and strategic marketing, and I leave my personal footprint on every project I touch. 
  I describe myself as a <b>creative person</b>, and my motto is “never stop learning,” while people tell me I am very empathic and detail-oriented.
  I practice <b>photography</b> in my free time and I often dedicate to fitness, cooking and music. In general, I like anything that is “aesthetic” and artistic.</p>

<p>I have recently specialized in Web Development as a full stack developer and I am now able to code via <b>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</b>. Soon I will practice more languages such as Node, React and more.</p>

<br />

<h2>My Background and Specialization</h2>
<p>I am a <b>marketing professional</b> and can work at 360° on marketing strategies and operative marketing.</p>
<p>Last year I have presented the <b>marketing plan</b> for the company where I work at: I analyzed the turnover and EBITDA trends over 4 years, as well as performed a qualitative analysis based on client's interviews to understand where the company was positioned in the mind of consumers, and then proposed strategic activities such as rebranding of the entire identity of the company, participation to specific events in our target client's sector (retail), improving digital marketing initiatives such as social media management, content creation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has proven to be essential to create a stronger company culture, which the company was lacking and caused high employee turnover. For this reason, I also created an <b>internal communication plan</b> and, last year, we started inviting the teams to team building activities.</p>

<br />

<h3>There's even more to this :-) </h3>
<p>I am also passionate about languages and traveling: since my teen years, I have been studying English and German, and in 2015 I got my <b>Bachelor's Degree in Linguistic and Cultural Mediation</b>, while during my Master's Degree I made a <b>6-month stay in Germany</b> with the Erasmus+ Program and perfected my knowledge of both languages. I have also studied Hindi for one year and spanish for three years. My next ambition is to learn Japanese.</p>
